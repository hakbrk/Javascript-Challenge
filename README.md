### Project Description

The purpose of this project was to take data contained in a javascript array and rending it in table format on an html page.

#### UFO-1   
- Add the functionality to filter by date.  In order to accomplish this a start date and end date input form was added.
- Both the start and end date fields are constrained to only dates which are available in the dataset.
- A start date must be input, if not an alert window will pop up to inform the user.
- If only a start date is input it will filter the request date and later.
- If a start date which is before the end date is input an alert window will pop up to inform the user.

#### UFO-2
- Added functionality to filter be other fields in the dataset.
- In order to accomplish this a module from tablefilter.com was utilized.
- Code was added into the drawtable function that then renders drop down filters at the table headers.
